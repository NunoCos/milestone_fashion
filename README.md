### 2. Scope

- Fits in with my current skill-set of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Django.

- Website information clearly relayed upon entering the home page.

- Easy way to Sign Up, Log in and Log out.

- Allow admin create, read, update and delete products.

### 3. Structure

The idea of the website is simple. Allow the user to buy a product and safely checkout.

The website has the same design to keep consistency and provide easy and friendly navigation to the user.

A clear communication is provided to the user after some interactions, using the messages function in Django.
